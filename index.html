          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Poverty has long been recognized as a contributor to death and disease, but several recent trends have generated an
            increased focus on the link between income and health. </p>

          <p>First, income inequality in the United States has increased dramatically in recent decades,
            while health indicators have plateaued, and life expectancy differences by income have grown.</p>
          <p>Second, there is growing scholarly and public recognition that many
            nonclinical factors—education, employment, race, ethnicity, and geography—influence health outcomes.</p> 
          <p>Third, healthcare payment and delivery system reforms have encouraged an
            emphasis on addressing social determinants of health, including income.</p>
