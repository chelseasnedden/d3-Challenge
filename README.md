## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! I've been tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand my findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. I'll be sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [Census ACS 2014 Results](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler (Required Assignment)

I have created a scatter plot between two of the data variables: `Healthcare vs. Poverty`.

Using the D3 techniques I learned in class, I will create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. I'll code this graphic in the `app.js` file of this directory— pulling in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
